# Find The Drug in Health Data using Tableau 

Welcome to the Healthcare Drug Detection project! This Tableau project aims to analyze and detect different types of drugs in the healthcare industry, specifically focusing on generic drugs and branded drugs. By utilizing a dataset consisting of information from 815 prescribers.

 we explore key metrics such as average claims per prescriber, average 30-day refills per prescriber, and average drug costs per prescriber, which provide valuable insights into drug usage and prescribing patterns.

## ProjectOverview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of drug utilization in the healthcare sector. By leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities

 we have created a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various aspects of drug prescription and costs. 

This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to gain insights into the prescribing behavior of healthcare professionals.


## Data-Source
 
   The data used in this project is derived from a dataset containing information from 815 prescribers. It includes details such as prescriber ID, drug types, claims, refills, and drug costs. Due to data sensitivity, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. However, you can replace it with your own dataset following the provided format for similar analysis.

## KeyFeatures


- Drug Type Detection: 
   
    The project focuses on distinguishing between generic drugs and branded drugs. Through advanced data analysis techniques, we identify patterns and trends in drug prescriptions to classify them accurately.


- Prescriber Metrics:
    
    We examine important metrics such as average claims per prescriber, average 30-day refills per prescriber, and average drug costs per prescriber. These metrics shed light on prescribing habits and can be useful for understanding prescription patterns.

- Data Visualization: 

    Tableau's robust visualization capabilities are utilized to create interactive charts, graphs, and maps, enabling users to explore and understand the data intuitively. The visualizations provide valuable insights into drug utilization and facilitate data-driven decision making.




## Insights

The project offers the following key insights based on the analyzed data:

- Average Claims Per Prescriber: 
   
    With an average of 13,766 claims per prescriber, the  project highlights the overall volume of prescriptions and provides a measure of the workload for each prescriber.

- Average 30-Day Refills Per Prescriber: 

    This metric, with an average of 16,306 refills per prescriber, indicates the frequency at which patients require refills for their prescriptions.

- Average Drug Costs Per Prescriber: 

    By examining the average drug costs per prescriber, which amounts to $6,356,035, the project helps identify the financial implications and expenses associated with drug prescriptions.
